DATOID
======

**Datoid** is a bare-bones CMS designed to provide users with maximum flexibility and creative control. It is based on the concept of the `Datoid`, which defines a *type* of data, analogous to a table in a database. These Datoids are fully customizable, including the name and number of fields they contain as well the relationships they maintain with other Datoids (i.e. many-to-many, one-to-many, etc.).

It's not (really) a CMS
-----------------------

The idea is to provide only the bare minimum required to create a functioning website with dynamic content. `Datoid` is a tool that first allows for the creation of a site's underlying structure, then provides tools with which to generate the content that will fill that structure.

It is, of course, a work in progress. I've uploaded it to GitHub only for my own version control / working purposes - an initial release is still many moons away.
